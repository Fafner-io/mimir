## About Mimir

Mimir is a humble attempt at creating a new tool for organizing corporations and alliances in Eve Online. It is focused around industry as the key enabler for any organization in the game, and is looking to provide the full collection of tools used by industrialists in one user friendly application.

The project is named after Mimir, a god in Norse mythology, known for being one of the wisest of gods. It seeks to be your one source of wisdom as an industrialist in Eve Online.

## Installation

* We might have to implement some code, before you can actually install and run it. *

### Requirements

* Still figuring these out. Most likely we need Node.js. *

## Demonstration

* We might have to implement some code, before it is possible to give a demonstration. *

## Roadmap

In the first release of Mimir, the following functions are planned:

* Selecting a route using existing systems in New Eden.
* Validate that the route consists only of highsec systems (no islands).
* Generate a dynamic price based on route length, collatoral, and urgency.
* Protected access to the calculator by validating using Eve Online's SSO.
